# LittleShakespeare

This is a simple character-level language model that uses a Recurrent Neural Network that is implemented in Python with Tensorflow.

Different RNN cells such as Basic-, GRU- or LSTM-Cells can be used and compared with each other. The implementation is very flexible and both depth and width can be freely chosen.

The code consists of a training and a test module. The test module can be used to create new Shakespeare plays.

Here are some results:
